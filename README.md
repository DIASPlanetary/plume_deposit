This code has been developed by:
- Isabelle Ledwidge
- Marina Casado
- Hans Huybrighs

## Isabelle Ledwidge's Capstone Project 2023
This project aims to analyse particle concentrations produced by plume eruptions on Europa.
The current endgoal is to make a mapping of particle densities on Europa's surface.
This project is supervised by Hans Huybrighs.

To run the code you must import:
-  neutral_europa_input.py
-  orbit_tools
-  coordinate_transformation
-  neutral_trajectories_tools
-  density
-  nim_simulation_tools

I will work on this
